### What's the workshop topic?
> ML4LMS aims to highlight translational machine learning research in biology and chemistry for real-world applications in life and materials science. The goal is to bridge theoretical advances with practical applications and connect academic and industry researchers.

We welcome a broad range of submissions, from dataset curation, analysis and benchmarking work highlighting opportunities and pitfalls of current ML applications in health and materials, to novel models and algorithms unlocking unprecedented capabilities.

We welcome all types of ML algorithms and models relevant for this problem space.

Lastly, we aim to integrate two areas - life and material sciences â€“ as ML approaches in these areas can usually be adapted to one or the other discipline, and we want to encourage discussion between practitioners in the respective fields. 

Need more inspiration? Have a look at the schedule to see who we invited, and our organizing committes to find out the people behind the workshop.

#### Where do I submit?
Submission to the ML4LMS 2024 workshop  will be entirely electronic, via OpenReview. 

Do it via the [ML4LMS venue via OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2024/Workshop/ML4LMS&referrer=%5BHomepage%5D(%2F)#tab-your-consoles)

### What can I submit?
- You can submit either a poster or free text (e.g. long abstract, summary style, or short paper).

- This workshop will adopt a double-blind review process. 

- Do not include author information, acknowledgements, or any other identifying information in your initial submission.

- Poster and free text submissions must be in PDF format.

- For posters, see the official instructions on the ICML website (workshop posters).

- For free text submissions, please adhere to the guidelines below. We provide both a Google Docs and LaTeX template for you to base your free text submission on. Please do not alter the style in these templates â€“ in particular, do not compress the paper format by reducing the vertical spaces or the page margins.

### What can I get out of submitting?
All accepted submissions (including free text) can submit a poster for in-person and online presentation. Accepted posters and/or free text will be collated in an informal proceeding.

Some submissions will be selected for a contributed 10 minute talk (see schedule).

Some submissions will be selected for prizes (TBD).

Students from underrepresented communities submitting free text and accepted into the workshop can request financial assistance to attend ICML, which will be granted based on availability of funds.

### Free text submission guidelines
- Initial submissions can be up to 5 pages long. This limit excludes data availability statements, references and appendices, which can take unlimited space. But the reviewers are not required to read appendices. Accepted papers can be up to 6 pages long, not including acknowledgements, data availability statements, references and appendices.

- Font should be 10 point Times (9 point for table and figure captions). Vertical line spacing should be 11 points.

- Place figure captions under the figure (and omit titles from inside the graphic file itself). Place table captions over the table.

- References must include page numbers whenever possible and be as complete as possible. Place multiple citations in chronological order.

- Do not alter the style templates provided below; in particular, do not compress the paper format by reducing the vertical spaces or the page margins.

- Keep your abstract brief and self-contained, one paragraph and roughly 4â€“6 sentences / 250 words.

### What about the camera ready version?
You will have the opportunity to submit a "camera ready" version of your poster/free text after notification of acceptance.

### Can I opt-out of the collated proceeding?
While the workshop is non-archival, we will collate camera-ready submissions into a proceeding available on this website for later download.

You can opt-out of having your camera-ready submission included by selecting this option on the submission form post-acceptance.

### Is there a cost associated to the submission?
While submitting is free, if you are selected for a poster or a talk, you'll need to purchase an ICML 2024 ticket in order to attend the workshop. 

### Can I attend without submitting?
Yes! The workshop is open to anyone attending ICML 2024.

### Can I review submissions?
Yes! We are looking for helping hands (all levels of seniority) in reviewing submissions. Reviewers will be listed on the website. If you submit something yourself, please make sure to disclose this in our reviewer form!

### What's the reviewing process?
We aim to have 3-4 people look at each submission. Approve/reject recommendations are mandatory, but we encourage comments and more detailed feedback.

### Is that true we're eligible to win prizes?
Yes! Thanks to NVIDIA's generous sponsorship we have 4 prizes

Check the [Prizes Page](/prizes) for more details
