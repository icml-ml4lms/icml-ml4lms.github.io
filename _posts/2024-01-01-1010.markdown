## Coffee Break sponsored by IQ Capital
IQ Capital’s general partners, Kerry Baldwin, Max Bautin, Simon Hirtzel and Ed Stacey, have worked together for more than 20 years, investing in innovative Deep Tech companies that are distinctly identifiable within the market for possessing defensible IP, breakthrough technologies and global ambitions. Our PhD-rich team has achieved over 20 exits to date, including trade sales to Oracle, Google, Apple, Facebook, Siemens and several IPOs. 

“IQ Capital has been central to Thought Machine’s success. They invested $2.5m at Seed stage, following on through their Growth fund as we expanded globally. IQ Capital provided much more: their experience in Deep Tech development and commercialisation is unrivalled and they fully stand behind founders through good times and bad. We rightly regard IQ Capital as a partner for our whole journey.”

Paul Taylor, Thought Machine
