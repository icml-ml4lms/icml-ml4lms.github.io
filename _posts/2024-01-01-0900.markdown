## Development and application of protein-ligand co-folding models for small molecule drug discovery 
A deep learning-based protein-ligand co-folding model, DragonFold, has been developed. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on protein-ligand structure prediction. DragonFold has been applied to live drug discovery projects, some of which will be demonstrated in the talk.
