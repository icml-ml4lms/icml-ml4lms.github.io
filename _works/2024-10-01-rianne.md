I am a Principal Research Manager at Microsoft Research Amsterdam, where I work on the intersection of deep learning and computational chemistry and physics for molecular simulation. My research has spanned a range of topics from generative modeling, variational inference, source compression, graph-structured learning to condensed matter physics. Before joining MSR I was a Research Scientist at Google Brain. I received my PhD in theoretical condensed-matter physics in 2016 at the University of Amsterdam, where I also worked as a postdoctoral researcher as part of the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLAB). In 2019 I won the Faculty of Science Lecturer of the Year award at the University of Amsterdam for teaching a machine learning course in the master of AI.
