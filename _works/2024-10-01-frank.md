Frank Noé is a Microsoft Partner Research Manager in the Berlin/Germany team of Microsoft Research (MSR) AI4Science. He also holds a professorship at Freie Universität Berlin and an adjunct professorship at Rice University Houston. Frank has received two European Research Council (ERC) grants, is an ISI highly cited fellow and is member of Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences.

Frank has a BSc degree in Electrical Engineering, a MSc in Computer Science and a PhD from University of Heidelberg (Germany) on Computer Science and Biophysics. Since his PhD he has pursued an interdisciplinary research program on the interface of molecular simulation, statistics and machine learning. His main research interests are in the development of deep learning methods to promote our ability to simulate and understand molecular systems, in particular addressing fundamental challenges such as the electronic structure problem in quantum Chemsitry and many-body sampling problem in statistical Mechanics.

Frank has co-pioneered the Markov state modeling (MSM) approach for describing the long-time dynamics of proteins and other macromolecules, has developed several deep learning systems for molecular simulation, such as the Boltzmann Generator, and is an advocate of open research and software for the benefit of society.
