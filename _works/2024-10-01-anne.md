From EPFL Website:

I was trained in physics, and always had a strong interest in biology. I am broadly interested in understanding biological phenomena in a quantitative way, through physical concepts and mathematical and computational tools. I investigate the relative impacts of optimization and historical contingency in biological evolution, both at the scale of protein sequences and at the scale of microbial populations.
