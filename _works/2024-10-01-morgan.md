From Altos Labs' website:

*Dr. Morgan Levine is a Principal Investigator at the Altos Labs San Diego Institute of Science*

Prior to joining Altos, Morgan was a ladder rank professor at Yale University School of Medicine. She is considered a leader in the biology of aging, most famous for generating cutting-edge methods for quantifying the system dysregulation that occurs over an organismâ€™s lifetime. Her work relies on interdisciplinary approaches, integrating theories and techniques from computational and cellular biology to track trajectories aging cells and organisms take over time. Morgan's vision is to develop multi-scale computational models that translate how dynamic molecular states of cells lead to manifestations of health and disease at the tissue, organ-system, or organismal level. She has received numerous awards for her work, including the Vincent Cristofalo Rising Star Award in Aging Research in 2021 and the Nathan Shock New Investigator Award in 2020.
