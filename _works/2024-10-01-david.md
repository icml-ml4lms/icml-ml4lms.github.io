From David's Personal Website:

"I'm a staff research scientist at Google DeepMind. I'm also a visiting professor at Imperial College London in the Department of Physics, where I supervise work on applications of deep learning to computational quantum mechanics. My own research interests span artificial intelligence, machine learning and scientific computing.

Prior to joining DeepMind, I was a PhD student at the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia, where I worked on algorithms for analyzing and understanding high-dimensional data from neural recordings with Liam Paninski and nonparametric Bayesian methods for predicting time series data with Frank Wood. I also had a stint as a research assistant in the group of Mike DeWeese at UC Berkeley, jointly between Physics and the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience.

Current research interests include applications of machine learning to computational physics and connections between differential geometry and unsupervised learning.""
